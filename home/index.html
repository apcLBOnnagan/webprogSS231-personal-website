        <div>About Me</div>
        My name is Lance Benedict Onnagan, a second-year Computer Science student at Asia Pacific College. I previously studied at Sta. Clara Parish School. 
        My IT experience mainly comes from studying at APC, where I have become familiar with Python and Java programming languages. In my free time, I enjoy drawing. 
        I have not set specific goals in my life yet because I want to explore myself and the world to form a concrete goal. Feel free to explore my picture gallery below
